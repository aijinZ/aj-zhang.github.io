I am a master student in the Research Center of Intelligent Transportation System at Sun Yat-Sen University. My research interests are machine learning and urban traffic data analytics. During my master research, I focused on spatio-temporal (multivariate and multidimensional) time series imputation and prediction, and the related papers have been published in the journal of *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies*.

Research Interests
======
- **Machine learning**:
  - Matrix/tensor factorization
  - Bayesian inference methods
  - Variational auto-encoder (VAE)
  - Generative adversarial network (GAN)
  - Bayesian neural network
- **Urban traffic data analytics**:
  - Missing data imputation
  - Spatio-temporal time series prediction
  - Anomaly detection
  - Individual trip patterns discovery
