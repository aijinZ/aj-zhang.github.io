I am a master student in the Research Center of Intelligent Transportation System at Sun Yat-Sen University. My research interests are machine learning and urban traffic data analytics. During my master research, I focused on spatio-temporal multivariate and multidimensional time series data imputation and prediction, and the related papers have been published in Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies.

Research Interests
======
* Data-driven machine learning models for transportation system
* Understanding human mobility with individual trip data
