- *Our very recent paper* - A Bayesian tensor decomposition approach for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (authors: Xinyu Chen, Zhaocheng He, Lijun Sun), is now available and published in the top journal - *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies*. The unique doi is [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.003). Prior to this version, the preprint is also available at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329177786_A_Bayesian_tensor_decomposition_approach_for_spatiotemporal_traffic_data_imputation). We also make our [data - Zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1205229) and [Matlab code - GitHub](https://github.com/lijunsun/bgcp_imputation) publicly available. An imputation example for a small tensor using BGCP is available at [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xinychen/transdim/blob/master/BGCP_example.ipynb).
